Since Grails 5.1.2, logging is handled by the http://logback.qos.ch[Logback logging framework] and can be configured with the `grails-app/conf/logback.xml` file.

For more information on configuring logging refer to the http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html[Logback documentation] on the subject.
